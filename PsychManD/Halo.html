      <h1>Halo</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Halo is an American military science fiction media franchise managed and developed by 343 Industries and published by Xbox Game Studios.<br>
         The franchise and its early main installments were originally developed by Bungie.<br>
         The central focus of the franchise builds off the experiences of Master Chief John-117, one of a group of supersoldiers codenamed Spartans, and his artificial intelligence (AI) companion, Cortana.</p>

              <p>Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, more commonly known as the Master Chief, is a SPARTAN-II commando of the UNSC Naval Special Warfare Command.
                <br> He is the protagonist and main character in both the Halo trilogy and Reclaimer Saga.

              <h3>Spartans</h3>
              <p>The SPARTAN Programs are a series of UNSC projects designed to create generations of physically, genetically, technologically, and mentally superior "supersoldiers" as a special fighting force within the UNSC Military.<br>
                The SPARTAN soldiers of the UNSC are named after the ancient Spartans of Greece, specifically during the famous Battle of Thermopylae.<br>
                 Catherine Halsey had three reasons to choose SPARTAN, rather than many other suggested code names. She believed the story of Thermopylae continued to be well-known and cherished throughout the 26th century.<br>
                  Coincidentally, the project was originally funded for 300 applicants. The Spartans' fierce reputation resulted from their legendary training, which began at the age of 6. Dr. Halsey planned to recreate a training system similar to the Spartans' in order to create the ultimate warrior. <br>
                  Spartan culture was based primarily on warfare, destroying newborns unable to meet strength and fitness requirements.<br>
                   Although considered barbaric during the modern era, Dr. Halsey arranged similar demands.</p>

              The Flood was responsible for consuming most of the sentient life in the galaxy, notably the Forerunners, during the 300-year-long Forerunner-Flood war.<br>
               The Flood presents the most variable faction in the trilogy, as it can infect and mutate Humans and Covenant species, such as Sangheili and Jiralhanae, into Combat Forms.<br>
               They are widely considered to be the greatest threat to the whole existence of life, or more accurately, biodiversity, in the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
